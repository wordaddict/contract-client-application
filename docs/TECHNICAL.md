## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Database**: SQLite with Sequelize ORM
   - Chosen for simplicity and ease of setup
   - In-memory database for testing
   - File-based storage for development

2. **Authentication**: Header-based authentication using `profile_id`
   - Simple and stateless
   - Easy to implement and test
   - No need for complex session management

3. **Caching**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
   - Improves performance for read-heavy operations
   - Reduces database load
   - Simple implementation with room for scaling

4. **Error Handling**: Custom error classes with consistent response format
   - Standardized error responses
   - Clear error types and messages
   - Easy to maintain and extend

5. **Security**: Multiple layers of security
   - Helmet for HTTP security headers
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Input sanitization
   - SQL injection prevention through ORM

6. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite
   - Unit tests for services and utilities
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Test database with seed data

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   npm run seed
   npm run seed:admin
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Style**
   - Follow ESLint configuration
   - Use async/await for asynchronous operations
   - Write meaningful comments and documentation

2. **Testing**
   - Write tests for all new features
   - Maintain test coverage above 80%
   - Use meaningful test descriptions

3. **Error Handling**
   - Use custom error classes
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log errors appropriately

4. **Security**
   - Validate all input
   - Sanitize user data
   - Follow security best practices

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database**
   - Use appropriate indexes
   - Optimize queries
   - Use transactions where necessary

2. **Caching**
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Implement cache invalidation
   - Monitor cache hit rates

3. **API Design**
   - Use pagination for large datasets
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Optimize response payloads

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Logging**
   - Log important operations
   - Include request IDs
   - Log errors with stack traces

2. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor API response times
   - Track error rates
   - Monitor database performance
